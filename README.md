#### Short Summary
I've reused my [final project](https://github.com/vinceldric/cpnt260-final) files in cpnt260 and converted my `html` files into `php` files. I've added an includes folder that contains my `head.php`, `header.php`, and `footer.php`. This process of organizing files is similar in JavaScript which uses `ejs` files instead.
